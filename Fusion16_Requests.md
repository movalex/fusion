## UI
All the UI tests are made on 1920x1200 monitor.

1. Node size scale is too big.
    - Currently Fusion 16 flow scale measurements are the same as in Fu9. For instance, the node name disappears from the view on the 0.6 scale of the Flowview in both versions. But since the nodes in fu16 are initially bigger, the text disappears too early, and we end up with normal size nodes without any text. https://cl.ly/5741fc26e46e
    - minimum scale is also too large. Here's side-by-side comparison of the minimum size flow in Fu16 and Fu9 https://cl.ly/8d096181e9a4
    - node elements (arrows, lines) should gradually scale down when scale is below 1. Right now they are only scaled on flow scale < 0.6 

2. Underlay draw
    - Underlays are drawn inconsistently. With minimum scale they are represented as outlines. They should be filled instead. https://cl.ly/2900fe6495f4

3. Too much unused space:
    - Keyframes view as a screaming example:
    https://cl.ly/62fc6277d620
        * line space too wide 
        * nodes list column is also too wide
        * unusable lock icon before node name (does not reflect if the node is locked, so what is it for?)
        * Feature request: add more articulate indication if the single keyframe is selected.

4. Three dots buttons in the window corners that do nothing (Inspector, Nodes window). If the menu is empty, the button should not appear https://cl.ly/a3f3ab9e9c55

5. On-screen view controls are hidden behind context menus, this triples the amount of clicks. We need DoD, lock view, show normalized buttons. Also show only selected tool button in Splines and Keyframes.

6. Oddly enough some buttons remained text only, such as `HQ`, `MB`, `Some`. We need an option for text-only Toolbar buttons, like in Fu9

7. Set viewer scale button does not toggle the dropdown. Scale menu is not activated when clicked on the scale size (only on the down arrow) https://cl.ly/85c39c43955a. This goes to any dropdown triangle buttons.

8. Animated elements should be outlined, like in Fu9. Red dot is just not enough.

9. Add flexible layout option. This is a huge theme, I'll just emphasize the small things. Fusion became an industry standard for VFX for the flexibility it gives the artist. Someone needs huge node tree, someone needs vast viewer. Developers need a dockable console. Someone moves the Inspector to the left, because operates with left hand, and it just speeds up the whole workflow. Someone aligns the nodes vertically. This is not a demand of the spoiled artists that just object new UI because it is new and they are not familiar with it. Fusion 16 UI just shackles artist's freedom. So flexible layout is a must for Fusion.

10. Add fullscreen view for Fusion, double monitor UI, like in Resolve (yes, we love Resolve too!)

11. Add custom scripts buttons in a toolbar. Add movable toolbar. Ok, this goes to flexible UI too.

12. Add parameters for current tool in Viewer. Add jump to currently viewed tool from the Viewer.

Other feature requests:

## Console
1. Expandable console UI with syntax highlighting
2. Dockable Console UI
3. Save last commands history on Fusion restart

## Rendering
1. Render queue branching
2. Cache to disk format options

## 3d
1. Mesh clipping (not alpha, but real polygon slicing)
2. Polygon count optimisation node (ideally dependent on how far the camera is)
3. Projection mode for spherical camera
4. Enable decay on camera projection
5. Lights with specular only mode
6. Cast shadows from all lights. PBR Render (yes, I know)
7. Advanced UV Mapping tool

## Node Management
1. Batch change properties for multiple selected nodes.
2. Copy tool with keystroke-mouse drag
3. Dock scripts UI in the main UI.
