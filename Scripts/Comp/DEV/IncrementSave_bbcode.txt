The script logic is based on IncrementalSave tool written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have ganular incremention of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because sometimes saving VFX Connect version may become a tedious task.

[i]Usage:[/i]

[list]
[*]Run the script from [c]Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave[/c] folder or use [c]Alt+S[/c] shortcut
[*]The comp version will be saved to  IncrementSave/comp_name folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.
[*]versions are saved with [c]0001[/c] incremention
[*]You can also set $INCREMENT_SAVE_PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder
[/list]

[i]Key features:[/i]
