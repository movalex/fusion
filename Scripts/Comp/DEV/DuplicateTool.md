## Duplicate Tool script

**Description:**

This script basically copies and pastes everything you have selected and tries to duplicate the input connections as well. You can use it to duplicate wireless nodes too. It is based on a hos_Duplicate.lua script, written in 2013 by Sven Neve (House of Secrets).

**Usage:**

* select any number of nodes and run the script or use shortcut `SHIFT+D`
* if you want to place duplicated nodes to a certain place in the flow, after selecting nodes and before using the script, use `SHIFT + click` somewhere on the Flow. Duplicated tools will appear the last place you clicked.
