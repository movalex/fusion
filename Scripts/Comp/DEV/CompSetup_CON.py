    Setup New Comp from Selected Loader

    The file convention for this project is:
    project_shot_author_version.comp
    i.e.: CON_0160_ab_v01.comp

    USAGE:
        1. open comp template in `2210_Consumed\PROJECTS\#Fusion Template` folder
        2. select the loader and choose the file you've been assigned to
        3. run the script. 

    What the script does:
    * create comp folder, if not exists
    * save comp file with correct name
    * update the savers paths according to new comp name
    * set render range based on the loader's length

    If the script is run multiple time, new comp version will be created.
    To set the comp author to your initials adjust the AUTHOR variable in the script source.
