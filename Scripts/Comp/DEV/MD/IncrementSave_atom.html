<p>The script logic is based on IncrementalSave tool written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have ganular incremention of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because sometimes saving VFX Connect version may become a tedious task.</p>
<p><em>Usage:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Run the script from <code>Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave</code> folder or use <code>Alt+S</code> shortcut</li>
<li>The comp version will be saved to  <code>IncrementSave/&lt;comp_name&gt;</code> folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.</li>
<li>versions are saved with <code>0001</code> incremention</li>
<li>You can also set $INCREMENT_SAVE_PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE:</em></p>
<p>The script requires Python3. If by any chance you prefer to use Lua, feel free to use <code>hos_IncrementSave.lua</code> script, included to this this Reactor installation. This is original <code>HoS</code> script, tinkered to support macos file paths. </p>
<p>However Python3 version of the script has some advangates: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it works correctly if the comp path has some non-ascii characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increment save folder will look the same on Mac and PC - without the '.comp' part</p>
</li>
</ul>
