<p><em>Requirements:</em> Python 3.6+</p>
<p>The script logic is based on IncrementalSave tool written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have granular incrementation of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because saving VFX Connect versions may be unwanted.</p>
<p><em>Usage:</em>
* Run the script from <code>Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave</code> folder or use <code>Alt+S</code> shortcut
* The comp version will be saved to  <code>IncrementSave/&lt;comp_name&gt;</code> folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.
* versions are saved with <code>0001</code> incrementing
* You can also set $INCREMENT_SAVE_PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em>
The script requires Python3. If by any chance you prefer to use Lua, feel free to use <code>hos_IncrementSave.lua</code> script, included to this this Reactor installation. This is original lua script written by @svenneve, fixed to support macos file paths. </p>
<p>However Python3 version of the script has some advantages: </p>
<ul>
<li>it works if the comp path has some non-ascii characters.</li>
<li>increment save folder will look the same on Mac and PC - without the '.comp' part</li>
</ul>
