[b]Description:[/b]
This script basically copies and pastes everything you have selected and tries to duplicate the input connections as well. You can use it to duplicate wireless nodes too. It properly fixes number of inputs for some multi-input tools, such ad  Merge3D or Replicate3D, in case some inputs were disconnected or rearranged. This script is based on a hos_Duplicate.lua, written by Sven Neve (House of Secrets) in 2013. 



[b]Usage:[/b]

[*]if you want to place duplicated nodes to a certain place in the flow, after selecting nodes and before using the script, do a [c]SHIFT + click[/c] somewhere on the Flow. After the script is run, duplicated tools will appear at the last place you've clicked.
