[i]Requirements:[/i] Python 3.6+

The script logic is based on IncrementalSave tool written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have ganular incremention of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because sometimes saving VFX Connect version may become a tedious task.

[i]Usage:[/i]

[list]
[*]Run the script from [c]Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave[/c] folder or use [c]Alt+S[/c] shortcut
[*]The comp version will be saved to  [c]IncrementSave/<comp_name>[/c] folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.
[*]versions are saved with [c]0001[/c] incremention
[*]You can also set $INCREMENT_SAVE_PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder
[/list]


[i]NOTE:[/i]

The script requires Python3. If by any chance you prefer to use Lua, feel free to use [c]hos_IncrementSave.lua[/c] script, included to this this Reactor installation. This is original [c]HoS[/c] script, tinkered to support macos file paths. 

However Python3 version of the script has some advangates: 

[list]
[*]it works correctly if the comp path has some non-ascii characters.
[/list]

[list]
[*]increment save folder will look the same on Mac and PC - without the '.comp' part
[/list]
