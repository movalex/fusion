[size=200][b]IncrementSave   script[/b][/size]
The script logic is based on [url=https://www.svenneve.com/?p=175]IncrementalSave tool[/url] written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have granular incrementation of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because saving VFX Connect versions may be unwanted.
[i]Usage:[/i]
[list]
[*]Run the script from [c]Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave[/c] folder or use [c]Alt+S[/c] shortcut
[*]The comp version will be saved to  [c]IncrementSave/<comp_name>[/c] folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.
[*]versions are saved with [c]0001[/c] incrementing
[*]You can also set[i]SAVE[/i]PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder
[/list]
[i]NOTE:[/i] The script requires Python3. If by any chance you prefer to use Lua, feel free to use [c]hos_IncrementSave.lua[/c] script, included to this this Reactor installation. This is original lua script written by [mention]svenneve[/mention], fixed to support macos file paths. 

However Python3 version of the script has some advantages: 

[list]
[*]it works if the comp path has some non-ascii characters.
[*]increment save folder will look the same on Mac and PC - without the '.comp' part
