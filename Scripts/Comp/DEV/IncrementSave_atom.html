<p>The script logic is based on IncrementalSave tool written by S.Neve / House of Secrets. The idea is to have ganular incremention of the Fusion compositions without cluttering current folder with version files. It is also a great companion to a VFX Connect workflow, because sometimes saving VFX Connect version may become a tedious task.</p>
<p><em>Usage:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Run the script from <code>Scripts/Comp/IncrementSave</code> folder or use <code>Alt+S</code> shortcut</li>
<li>The comp version will be saved to  IncrementSave/comp_name folder next to the current comp file. If this folder does not exists, it will be created.</li>
<li>versions are saved with <code>0001</code> incremention</li>
<li>You can also set $INCREMENT_SAVE_PATH environment variable to have your increment saves in specific folder</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key features:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new comp version will be saved next to the current comp in the <code>IncrementSave</code> folder with a subfolder named as the current comp name. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the script will work correctly if the comp path has non-ascii characters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increment save folder will look the same on Mac and PC - without the '.comp' part</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE:</em></p>
<p>The script requires Python3. If you are still using Python2, feel free to use hos_IncrementSave.lua from this Reactor installation</p>
